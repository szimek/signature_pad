Signature Pad
=============

HTML5 canvas based smooth signature drawing using variable width Bézier curve interpolation based on [Smoother Signatures](http://corner.squareup.com/2012/07/smoother-signatures.html) post by [Square](https://squareup.com).

Demo (works on desktop and mobile browsers) at http://szimek.github.io/signature_pad.

Example:

## Usage

``` javascript
var canvas = document.querySelector("canvas");

var signaturePad = new SignaturePad(canvas);

// Returns signature image as data URL
signaturePad.toDataURL();

// Draws signature image from data URL
signaturePad.fromDataURL("data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0K...");

// Clears the canvas
signaturePad.clear();

// Returns true if canvas is empty, otherwise returns false
signaturePad.isEmpty();
```

### Handling data URI encoded images on the server side
If you are not familiar with data URI scheme, you can read more about it on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme).

There are 2 ways you can handle data URI encoded images. 

You could simply store it in your database as a string and display it in HTML like this:

``` html
<img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0K..." />
```

but this way has many disadvantages - it's not easy to get image dimensions, you can't manipulate it e.g. to create a thumbnail and it also [has some performance issues on mobile devices](http://www.mobify.com/blog/data-uris-are-slow-on-mobile/).

Thus, more common way is to decode it and store as a file. Here's an example in Ruby:

``` ruby
require "base64"

data_uri = "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0K..."
encoded_image = data_uri.split(",")[1]
decoded_image = Base64.decode64(encoded_image)
File.open("signature.png", "wb") { |f| f.write(decoded_image) }
```
